## [unreleased]

- Running 'miniver' without any arguments invokes the 'ver' command
- Miniver now works with namespace packages

## [0.7.0] - 2020-08-15
### Added
- Allow distributions that place packages in a "src" directory
### Changed
- Replace tool "install-miniver" with a tool "miniver" with a command "install"

- Use "build_py" from setuptools, rather than distutils, which prevents a warning
  being displayed when using more recent setuptools versions

### Fixed
- Typos in generated files (comments only)
- Dedented template code produced by 'install-miniver' to make it copy-pasteable.
